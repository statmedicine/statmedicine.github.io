Mrs B is a 65F admitted with NSTEMI. BG T2Dm usually managed with Jardiamet (metformin, empagliflozin) and Ryzodeg 70/30 20U prebreakfast and 20U predinner. You are called to see her because her post-dinner BGL is 20mM. What other information do you need? What do you do? How worried should I be? Check ketones if BGL > 15, especially in T1DM or on SGLT2i (r/o DKA) Normal ketones < 0.5 Worse case scenario - DKA Why is she hyperglycaemic? Did she get her usual dinner insulin Is she septic Did she just eat before the reading? Is this a recurrent pattern - i.e. does her usual insulin need to be adjusted? Is she still on her usual medications? Has she had any recent hypos? Management 1. Short term - stat dose of rapid acting insulin if no recent insulin/no hypos - e.g. 4 units novorapid and recheck in 2 hours to ensure downtrending - do NOT use the supplemental - this is for pre-meals ONLY 2. Long term - ask day team to review - Use of SGLT2i - risks euglycaemic DKA - Consider switching to basal bolus insulin / Endo consult Note that increasing ryzodeg at dinner will increase dinner insulin but ALSO basal - and increase drop in BGLs overnight Insulin sensitivity factor (correction = 100/total daily dose) If Mrs B is on a total of 40U insulin in a day: ISF = 100/40 = 2.5 i.e. 1 unit of insulin should lower BGL by ~ 2.5 if aiming to drop BGL by 10 (i.e. from 20 -> 10), then we need 4U of insulin In insulin sensitive patients (elderly, renal impairment, type 1 diabetics, slim patients on low dose insulin) - reduce dose to avoid hypoglycaemia consider halving what you would normally give Case 2 You are the night intern.

How worried should I be? Is he alert and able to eat? Was he symptomatic? - not feeling hypos is not good sign! What treatment has he had? - should have self initiated hypoglycaemia, don't double up! Why is he hypoglycaemic? Is this a recurrent problem (i.e. issue with insulin dosing?) Was there a medication error Is he eating less than usual Is he more active than usual (e.g. physio) 1. Is he conscious? 1. Conscious - fast acting carb (e.g. glucogel) followed by long acting carb (sandwich) - give short acting carb then recheck in 15 minutes - If BGL < 4 -> repeat - If BGL > 4 -> Give long acting carb (risks hyperglycaemia but safer than hypoglycaemia) 2. Unconscious/poor oral intake - IV 25-50mL 50% dextrose (i.e. resus dose) - If no IV access, 1mg IM glucagon - Slow glucose - 5% glucose at 80mL/hr - 10% Glucose at 40mL/hr Other management options - once hypoglycaemic resolved 1.

Either the med reg can help you with this, or the team can consult Endocrine in the morning. Case 4 You are the night intern. You call miss C, 39F admitted with pneumonia. BG T1DM normally on MERdtronic 670G insulin pump. She begins vomiting in evening. Her BGL is 24 and ketones 4.2. What else do you need to know? What do you do? How worried should I be about this Worse kase DKA, best case hyperglycaemic with ketosis Urgent VBG to determine pH/carb Fluid balance and clinical examination Needs immediate senior involvement (med reg) for medical management (IVF, K, Insulin), possible HDU/ICU involvement Why has this occured? Check if cannula is attached to body and the pump is on Call the on call endocrinologist Likely to be either infection triggered DKA or pump failure - need to switch patient in insulin infusion as per DKA protocol Case 5 You are the night intern. Code blue called on your ward. You arrive at bedside and nurses report that Mrs S is unresponsive. She is an 86F with Hx of T2DM on insulin (optisulin 10U nocte, novorapid 4 with meals). Her BGL is 1.9. What do you do? IM glucagon 1mg STAT (in hypo kit) Make sure you find out what caused this - prevent from recurrence Next day pre-bed BGL is 3.6, do you give optisulin? 1. Hypoglycaemia needs treatment - give 15g fast acting carb, followed by a long acting carb - Aim for BGL of >= 7 prior to bed 2.

Supplemental Insulin (Insulin in the context of hyperglycaemia) Supplemental insulin is given in the form of rapid acting insulin analogues, such as Aspart (NovoRapid), Lispro (Humalog) or Glulisine (Apidra). Follow local guidelines first, however in absence of local guidelines, ACI suggests: If Pre-meal BGL is: - 10-12mM - give 2U rapid acting insulin - 12-18mM - give 4U rapid acting insulin - 18-20mM - give 6U rapid acting insulin - >=20mM - call clinical review Initiation of Insulin Therapy Type I Diabetes Contact diabetes registrar for assistance Basal bolus regimen: 0.3-0.4 units/kg/day (Total daily insulin dose) 1/3 as basal insulin before bed (e.g. lantus (glargine) or levemir (detemir)) 2/3 as rapid acting insulin divided equally before each meal (e.g. lispro (Humalog), aspart (Novorapid), glulisine (Apidra)) Give supplemental rapid acting insulin as required to correct hyperglycaemia Review glycaemic control and adjust insulin doses daily Type II Diabetes A. Oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) may be able to be continued/titrated in some cases, but consider cessation/dose reduction under the following circumstances: Metformin: Cease if eGFR < 30 or if rapidly progressive renal failure or if lactic acidosis. Reduce/withhold dose if eGFR 30-60 or if radio-contrast required. Metformin can be resumed if renal function improves sufficiently. Sulphonylureas: Consider ceasing/omitting if poor oral intake/risk of hypoglycaemia Glitazones: Cease if cardiac failure present Incretins: DPP4 Inhibitors/GLP1 agonists Cease DPPIV inhibitors/GLP1 analogues if pancreatitis present SGLT2 Inhibitors: Cease if has renal failure or urogenital infections Withhold if acute illness, fasting or preoperative. Consider screen for euglycaemic ketoacidosis B. Insulin: often ultimately necessary to achieve satisfactory glycaemic control, especially with: Pre-existing poor glycaemic levels (HbA1C > 8% on maximal oral hypoglycaemic agents or > 9% in any case) OR with precipitants e.g. glucocorticoids OR if usual oral hypoglycaemic agents have to be ceased Continue metformin if no contraindications. Cease other oral hypoglycaemic agents. Commence insulin: Total daily dose =0.3-0.5 units/kg/day (0.3 units for insulin sensitive, 0.5 units for standard). 50% of this to be given as once daily basal insulin (Lantus) 50% of this to be given as prandial (bolus) insulin e.g. Novorapid, Humalog, Apidra- should be given with meals. NB: If insulin is initiated in hospital, please ensure adequate time for discharge planning, either for a change to an appropriate discharge regimen (e.g. a bd premix or basal only regime) or to allow sufficient time for patient to be educated about insulin administration (please contact diabetes educator for education). Correction of Hyperglycaemia with Subcutaneous Insulin (see also guidance for commencing and Adjusting Basal bolus insulin) Avoid use of sliding scale insulin as sole therapy as it tends to exacerbate metabolic instability A change to basal-bolus insulin could be considered in patients with: Pre-existing poor glycaemic control (HbA1C > 8%) Risk factors for hyperglycaemia or fluctuations in blood glucose levels (e.g. > 10mg daily prednisolone or equivalent doses of glucocorticoids; enteric feeds) in patients with known diabetes mellitus Patients already on insulin or maximal doses of oral hypoglycaemic agents, particularly with other risk factors / high risk major surgery (e.g. coronary artery bypass surgery) Supplemental rapid acting insulin in addition to usual charted SC insulin at meal times may be advisable. Frequent need for supplemental insulin suggests that usual insulin needs may need to be increased. Supplemental insulin should not be given without concurrent regular review of charted insulin requirements. Supplemental Insulin Use Insulin Aspart (Novorapid) Supplemental insulin given in addition to prescribed premeal dose only Note: If patient very sensitive to insulin or problematic hypos, may need to avoid supplemental insulin Titration: Basal Insulin e.g. Lantus, Levemir If fasting and/or mean BGL > 10mmo/l and no hypoglycemia Increase by 10-20% (not more than 5 units) If mild hypoglycaemia (BGL 3.1- 4mmol/l) on single occasion Decrease by 10-20% if moderate- severe hypoglycaemia (BGL < 3mmol/l or decreased conscious state) or recurrent hypoglycaemia Decrease by 20-30% + endocrine consult Bolus (prandial) insulin e.g. Novorapid, Humalog, Apidra If the 2hr post-meal BGL exceeds 10 mmol/L (or target range for patient), that individual mealtime bolus should be increased the next day by 2-4 units If additional corrective doses of insulin are required, avoid excessive and overlapping doses of insulin. For significant hyperglycaemia, e.g. > 20mmol/l, a corrective dose of 0.1 units/kg of rapid acting insulin analogue could be considered (minimise night time doses because of risk of hypoglycaemia- not more than 0.025-0.05units/kg). If significant hyperglycaemia persists, consider intravenous variable dose insulin-glucose infusion Re-check BGL 2 hr after administration of extra insulin in order to ensure it has not been over- or under- effective Avoid giving extra insulin too frequently Give rapid-acting insulin analogues rather than regular human short acting insulin (such as Actrapid) given the more rapid onset of action and the reduced potential for overlapping of doses","title":"Hyperglycaemia"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Hyperglycaemia/#hyperglycaemia","text":"","title":"Hyperglycaemia"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Hyperglycaemia/#general-approach","text":"","title":"General approach"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Hyperglycaemia/#management-guidelines-aci","text":"If patient is NBM, vomiting or hyperglycaemic despite correction, consider insulin infusion If patient has T1DM and BGL > 15mM, check ketones then follow local guidelines Hydration and dietary status: is hyperglycaemia easily explained by dietary indiscretion?

Patients who develop delirium have higher mortality, institutionalisation and complication rates and longer lengths of stay than non-delirious patients. A transient cerebral dysfunction resulting in changing cognition and attention Delirium subtypes include: Hypoactive Hypoactive level of psychomotor activity accompanied by sluggishness and lethargy approaching stupor Hyperactive Hyperactive psychomotor activity accompanied by labile mood, agitation and/or refusal to cooperate with medical care Mixed Hyperactive and hypoactive alternation - most common in hospital Clinical features Disorientated to place/time Fluctuating level of alertness and consciousness \u2193Attention and \u2193Focus; \u2191Distractibility Tangential Unable to follow the conversation and discussion Perseverates on questions/answers provided before Visual/auditory hallucination Fluctuating level of mood New onset of incontinence Diagnosis Delirium is characterised by each of the following features: Disturbance of consciousness (i.e. reduced clarity of awareness of the environment) with reduced ability to focus, sustain or shift attention. A change in cognition (such as memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance) or the development of a perceptual disturbance that is not better accounted for by a pre-existing or evolving dementia. It is important to obtain a history from carers or relatives if at all possible. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to days) and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day. There is often evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is caused by the direct physiological consequences of a general medical condition; intoxication or substance withdrawal. Delirium is common post-operatively. Delirium can be idiopathic but should still be recognised and managed none-the-less. The Confusion Assessment Method Diagnostic Algorithm ( Inouye \u2013 Annals of Internal Medicine 1990 ) is a useful tool to assess a patient for delirium: Acute onset and fluctuating course Inattention Disorganised thinking Altered level of consciousness Be aware \u2013 often patients are demented and the confusional episode you are seeing is \u201csun downing\u201d \u2013 but always assume it is delirium if you are in doubt . Delirium necessitates thorough management to avoid harm to the patient. Drowsy delirious patients should be seen as a medical emergency. If you believe the patient is delirious management can be divided into 3 main areas: Identifying and treating the underlying causes of the patient\u2019s delirium Practical approaches to keeping the patient safe Medical treatment of delirium Possible causes Review medications \u2013 remove any medications that are not required Review antipsychotics - e.g. tricyclic antidepressants Review cardiac medications - e.g. methyldopa, antiarrhythmics, betablockers Review steroids Review antidepressants Review anticholinergics Review sedatives (e.g. benzodiazepines) Review opioids. NSAIDs can also cause confusion (esp Indomethacin) Review diabetic medications \u2013 is the patient hypoglycaemic? Review anticonvulsants (E.g. barbituates) Review antiparkinsonian agents (e.g. Benztropine) Review antihistamines (1st generation e.g. Diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine) Review bowel habits \u2013 is the patient constipated? Antispasmotics and H2 blockers can enhance this issue Is the patient in urinary retention? Is the patient in pain but cannot explain this to you? Is the patient thirsty or dehydrated?

Whilst CRP is not specific in confirming sepsis it remains a useful test. Blood cultures Calcium Urea and electrolytes Liver function tests \u2013 look for evidence of prior alcohol consumption (GGT) and the nutritional status Glucose Thyroid function tests Chest X-ray ECG Urinalysis and culture Consider CT head and ABG if clinically indicated and if appropriate within the patient\u2019s advanced care directives Delirium often has more than one causal factor (i.e. multiple aetiologies) \u2013 so always keep looking!

There are a few definitions to be aware of: Injurious vs. non-injurious falls An injurious fall is one which causes an injury (E.g. fracture, head-strike) a non-injurious fall is one which doesn't cause physical injury Falls are a major cause of morbidity and disability to elderly patients. Fear of falling can be disabling and greatly affect the patient\u2019s quality of life. 1 year mortality after a hip fracture is currently 20-30%. If a patient falls on the wards there are several steps that would be very important to patient care. If the patient has had a head strike or there is a possibility of head injury order and review a CT head. This is a key recommendation of the Clinical Excellence Commission (CEC). The CEC post-fall guide can be found here: https://www.cec.health.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/258465/Post-Fall-Guide.pdf After a fall determine what factors would have contributed to the fall. If you require assistance with an elderly patient falling whilst under your care seek a geriatrician review to make recommendations to limit future risk of falls. All patients admitted to the hospital ward should be assessed by either the medical team or admitting nurse for falls risk. We currently use the ONTARIO-STRATIFY falls risk assessment. It is an embedded part of the current nursing admission form. A copy of this assessment form can be found here: https://www.cec.health.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/258472/NH606658-Ontario-Modified-Stratify-Sydney-Scoring-Falls-Risk-Screen.pdf It should be noted that the biggest risk factor for in-hospital falls is confusion or delirium. All confused patients should be assumed at high risk of falls and interventions and plans made to limit the patient\u2019s risk There are many interventions that can lessen the patient\u2019s risk of falls: If the patient is frail and requires assistance to the toilet arrange for scheduled nursing reviews and regular toileting assistance. If the patient is physically weak reinforce with the them the need to ask for assistance for transfers. Use the family to reinforce this need and enable the patient by ensuring the nursing call bell is in easy reach of the patient. Ensure the patient\u2019s mobility aids are well-placed and within easy reach Clear any clutter or furniture that might trip the patient Provide the patient with non-slip socks and remove any slippers or non-ideal footwear. If the patient is delirious ask for a geriatrician to provide recommendations and assistance with delirium management. Always review the patients medications. Antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and most psychoactive medications will increase the risk of falls and if deemed unnecessary should be discontinued. A detailed list of management recommendations is provided by the FRAMP.

If the patient has had a head strike or there is a possibility of head injury order and review a CT head. This is a key recommendation of the Clinical Excellence Commission (CEC). The CEC post-fall guide can be found here: https://www.cec.health.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/258465/Post-Fall-Guide.pdf After a fall determine what factors would have contributed to the fall. If you require assistance with an elderly patient falling whilst under your care seek a geriatrician review to make recommendations to limit future risk of falls. All patients admitted to the hospital ward should be assessed by either the medical team or admitting nurse for falls risk. We currently use the ONTARIO-STRATIFY falls risk assessment. It is an embedded part of the current nursing admission form. A copy of this assessment form can be found here: https://www.cec.health.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/258472/NH606658-Ontario-Modified-Stratify-Sydney-Scoring-Falls-Risk-Screen.pdf It should be noted that the biggest risk factor for in-hospital falls is confusion or delirium. All confused patients should be assumed at high risk of falls and interventions and plans made to limit the patient\u2019s risk There are many interventions that can lessen the patient\u2019s risk of falls: If the patient is frail and requires assistance to the toilet arrange for scheduled nursing reviews and regular toileting assistance. If the patient is physically weak reinforce with the them the need to ask for assistance for transfers. Use the family to reinforce this need and enable the patient by ensuring the nursing call bell is in easy reach of the patient. Ensure the patient\u2019s mobility aids are well-placed and within easy reach Clear any clutter or furniture that might trip the patient Provide the patient with non-slip socks and remove any slippers or non-ideal footwear. If the patient is delirious ask for a geriatrician to provide recommendations and assistance with delirium management. Always review the patients medications. Antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and most psychoactive medications will increase the risk of falls and if deemed unnecessary should be discontinued. A detailed list of management recommendations is provided by the FRAMP. This can be found at: https://www.cec.health.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/258467/Falls-Risk-Assessment-and-Management-Plan-FRAMP.pdf","title":"Geriatric falls"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Geriatrics/Geriatric%20admissions/","text":"Geriatric admissions Elderly patients often bring unique challenges to the resident. Always consider the following issues: Venous thromboembolic risk By virtue of their age and the propensity for immobility and chronic co-morbidities such as COPD and strokes elderly patients invariably are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism Start reviewing the patient\u2019s mobility early after an operation and refer to physiotherapy if required. Remove equipment that may impair their mobility such as indwelling catheters. Malnutrition Falls risk Always notify nursing staff if the patient is at risk of falls. Pressure sores Ask for 4 hourly turns and a pressure/air mattress. They have complex discharge planning needs. Think about potential issues with self-care early in the admission. Rehabilitation may need to be considered prior to discharge. An Occupational Therapist or Physiotherapist review may be required and should be organised prior to assessment for rehabilitation. Co-morbidities Elderly patients often have multiple medical issues. Is one of the patient\u2019s prior diagnosed issues currently causing problems? Is there another medical problem which has not yet been identified? They often have so much prior history they may not be able to recall it all! It is vital with all geriatric patients to obtain and review the patient\u2019s old notes. Medication reconciliation and accuracy of prescription is vitally important to geriatric patient care. Elderly patients are prone to polypharmacy and will be more vulnerable to medication errors and side effects. Be vigilant and accurate in re-writing medication charts. Doses of medications should always be confirmed with the patient and GP. Do not assume prior medication charts or discharge summaries are correct. Communication with all parties involved in the patient\u2019s care is vital. Discussion with relatives is often more important in elderly patients as they may be cognitively impaired and unable to remember your instructions or they may be reliant on their carers for assistance. Instructions to GPs, clearly stated changes to patient\u2019s medication list and instructions for follow-up must be clearly documented in the patient\u2019s discharge summary. It is often useful to discuss the patient\u2019s care with their GP. Prior to discharge it is useful to assess the patient\u2019s cognitive and functional status (e.g. using standardised tools such as MMSE and Barthel Index) to aid future management. It is appropriate to establish the patient\u2019s wishes regarding advanced care directives during each in-hospital admission.","title":"Geriatric admissions"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Geriatrics/Geriatric%20admissions/#geriatric-admissions","text":"Elderly patients often bring unique challenges to the resident.
