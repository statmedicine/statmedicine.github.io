Replacement Redistribution Reassessment Resuscitation fluids Resuscitation fluids are used if patient's appear clinically hypovolemic. Resuscitation fluids are always normal saline (0.9% NaCl). Bolus fluids are typically administered depending on medical history and risk factors. A good approach is as follows: If patients have cardiac failure, kidney or liver failure, or at risk of fluid overloading , bolus with ~150mL at a time If patients are older or with poorer kidney function , bolus with ~250mL at a time If patients are otherwise well individuals, bolus with ~500mL at a time After bolusing a patient, you should reassess within 15 minutes.

Did she get her usual dinner insulin Is she septic Did she just eat before the reading? Is this a recurrent pattern - i.e. does her usual insulin need to be adjusted? Is she still on her usual medications? Has she had any recent hypos? Management 1. Short term - stat dose of rapid acting insulin if no recent insulin/no hypos - e.g. 4 units novorapid and recheck in 2 hours to ensure downtrending - do NOT use the supplemental - this is for pre-meals ONLY 2. Long term - ask day team to review - Use of SGLT2i - risks euglycaemic DKA - Consider switching to basal bolus insulin / Endo consult Note that increasing ryzodeg at dinner will increase dinner insulin but ALSO basal - and increase drop in BGLs overnight Insulin sensitivity factor (correction = 100/total daily dose) If Mrs B is on a total of 40U insulin in a day: ISF = 100/40 = 2.5 i.e. 1 unit of insulin should lower BGL by ~ 2.5 if aiming to drop BGL by 10 (i.e. from 20 -> 10), then we need 4U of insulin In insulin sensitive patients (elderly, renal impairment, type 1 diabetics, slim patients on low dose insulin) - reduce dose to avoid hypoglycaemia consider halving what you would normally give Case 2 You are the night intern.

How worried should I be? Is he alert and able to eat? Was he symptomatic? - not feeling hypos is not good sign! What treatment has he had? - should have self initiated hypoglycaemia, don't double up! Why is he hypoglycaemic? Is this a recurrent problem (i.e. issue with insulin dosing?) Was there a medication error Is he eating less than usual Is he more active than usual (e.g. physio) 1. Is he conscious? 1. Conscious - fast acting carb (e.g. glucogel) followed by long acting carb (sandwich) - give short acting carb then recheck in 15 minutes - If BGL < 4 -> repeat - If BGL > 4 -> Give long acting carb (risks hyperglycaemia but safer than hypoglycaemia) 2. Unconscious/poor oral intake - IV 25-50mL 50% dextrose (i.e. resus dose) - If no IV access, 1mg IM glucagon - Slow glucose - 5% glucose at 80mL/hr - 10% Glucose at 40mL/hr Other management options - once hypoglycaemic resolved 1.

What do you do with his insulin? - T1DM need to be kept on basal dose, however should cease bolus insulin and be put onto insulin/dextrose infusion - From time of the first missed meal , begin insulin/dextrose infusion Mr A returns from theatres in the PM. Nurses ask you RE what to do with his insulin dextrose infusion. What do you need to know? - has anyone written a note? - Are they able to eat?

How worried should I be? if clinically well in T2DM, no need to check ketones Why is he hyperglycaemic? likely steroid induced hyperglycaemia Other questions How is his diabetes normally? i.e. baseline BGL and HbA1c Is he getting his normal medication? make sure not medical error What steroid dose is he getting tomorrow? make sure endocrine involved if recurrent problem Short term management - Short term correctional novorapid reasonable but not essential - He will be insulin resistant during the day (i.e. standard 4U novorapid may not touch him) and insulin sensitive during the evening/night when steroids wear off - i.e. when steroids are in his system, insulin may have little effect - however at night with reduced steroid load, insulin may be very sensitive Long term management - If he is still getting high dose steroids tomorrow, he likely needs regular insulin (e.g. morning protaphane). Either the med reg can help you with this, or the team can consult Endocrine in the morning. Case 4 You are the night intern. You call miss C, 39F admitted with pneumonia. BG T1DM normally on MERdtronic 670G insulin pump. She begins vomiting in evening. Her BGL is 24 and ketones 4.2. What else do you need to know? What do you do? How worried should I be about this Worse kase DKA, best case hyperglycaemic with ketosis Urgent VBG to determine pH/carb Fluid balance and clinical examination Needs immediate senior involvement (med reg) for medical management (IVF, K, Insulin), possible HDU/ICU involvement Why has this occured? Check if cannula is attached to body and the pump is on Call the on call endocrinologist Likely to be either infection triggered DKA or pump failure - need to switch patient in insulin infusion as per DKA protocol Case 5 You are the night intern. Code blue called on your ward. You arrive at bedside and nurses report that Mrs S is unresponsive. She is an 86F with Hx of T2DM on insulin (optisulin 10U nocte, novorapid 4 with meals). Her BGL is 1.9. What do you do? IM glucagon 1mg STAT (in hypo kit) Make sure you find out what caused this - prevent from recurrence Next day pre-bed BGL is 3.6, do you give optisulin? 1. Hypoglycaemia needs treatment - give 15g fast acting carb, followed by a long acting carb - Aim for BGL of >= 7 prior to bed 2.

How worried should I be? if clinically well in T2DM, no need to check ketones Why is he hyperglycaemic? likely steroid induced hyperglycaemia Other questions How is his diabetes normally? i.e. baseline BGL and HbA1c Is he getting his normal medication? make sure not medical error What steroid dose is he getting tomorrow? make sure endocrine involved if recurrent problem Short term management - Short term correctional novorapid reasonable but not essential - He will be insulin resistant during the day (i.e. standard 4U novorapid may not touch him) and insulin sensitive during the evening/night when steroids wear off - i.e. when steroids are in his system, insulin may have little effect - however at night with reduced steroid load, insulin may be very sensitive Long term management - If he is still getting high dose steroids tomorrow, he likely needs regular insulin (e.g. morning protaphane). Either the med reg can help you with this, or the team can consult Endocrine in the morning.","title":"Case 3"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Diabetes%20management%20cases/#case-4","text":"You are the night intern.

Oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) may be able to be continued/titrated in some cases, but consider cessation/dose reduction under the following circumstances: Metformin: Cease if eGFR < 30 or if rapidly progressive renal failure or if lactic acidosis. Reduce/withhold dose if eGFR 30-60 or if radio-contrast required. Metformin can be resumed if renal function improves sufficiently. Sulphonylureas: Consider ceasing/omitting if poor oral intake/risk of hypoglycaemia Glitazones: Cease if cardiac failure present Incretins: DPP4 Inhibitors/GLP1 agonists Cease DPPIV inhibitors/GLP1 analogues if pancreatitis present SGLT2 Inhibitors: Cease if has renal failure or urogenital infections Withhold if acute illness, fasting or preoperative.

NB: If insulin is initiated in hospital, please ensure adequate time for discharge planning, either for a change to an appropriate discharge regimen (e.g. a bd premix or basal only regime) or to allow sufficient time for patient to be educated about insulin administration (please contact diabetes educator for education). Correction of Hyperglycaemia with Subcutaneous Insulin (see also guidance for commencing and Adjusting Basal bolus insulin) Avoid use of sliding scale insulin as sole therapy as it tends to exacerbate metabolic instability A change to basal-bolus insulin could be considered in patients with: Pre-existing poor glycaemic control (HbA1C > 8%) Risk factors for hyperglycaemia or fluctuations in blood glucose levels (e.g. > 10mg daily prednisolone or equivalent doses of glucocorticoids; enteric feeds) in patients with known diabetes mellitus Patients already on insulin or maximal doses of oral hypoglycaemic agents, particularly with other risk factors / high risk major surgery (e.g. coronary artery bypass surgery) Supplemental rapid acting insulin in addition to usual charted SC insulin at meal times may be advisable. Frequent need for supplemental insulin suggests that usual insulin needs may need to be increased. Supplemental insulin should not be given without concurrent regular review of charted insulin requirements. Supplemental Insulin Use Insulin Aspart (Novorapid) Supplemental insulin given in addition to prescribed premeal dose only Note: If patient very sensitive to insulin or problematic hypos, may need to avoid supplemental insulin Titration: Basal Insulin e.g. Lantus, Levemir If fasting and/or mean BGL > 10mmo/l and no hypoglycemia Increase by 10-20% (not more than 5 units) If mild hypoglycaemia (BGL 3.1- 4mmol/l) on single occasion Decrease by 10-20% if moderate- severe hypoglycaemia (BGL < 3mmol/l or decreased conscious state) or recurrent hypoglycaemia Decrease by 20-30% + endocrine consult Bolus (prandial) insulin e.g. Novorapid, Humalog, Apidra If the 2hr post-meal BGL exceeds 10 mmol/L (or target range for patient), that individual mealtime bolus should be increased the next day by 2-4 units If additional corrective doses of insulin are required, avoid excessive and overlapping doses of insulin. For significant hyperglycaemia, e.g. > 20mmol/l, a corrective dose of 0.1 units/kg of rapid acting insulin analogue could be considered (minimise night time doses because of risk of hypoglycaemia- not more than 0.025-0.05units/kg).

Glucagon 1mg IM can be given if intravenous access is not attainable (but requires re-suspension and may not be readily available in ward \u2013 check resuscitation trolley). Recheck Blood glucose level (BGL) after 5-15 minutes (sooner if poor conscious state or other symptomatic concerns) a. If BGL < 4mmol/l, re-treat / repeat BGL monitoring as above. b. If BGL > 4.0 mmol/l Give sandwich or other meal with carbohydrate If fasting or poor oral intake: 5% Glucose at 80ml/hr or 10% Glucose at 40ml/hr OR if already receiving IV glucose, may need increase in rate or concentration Recheck BGL after another 2 hr a. Type I Diabetes: Do NOT OMIT insulin , though the dose may need to be reduced by 20-40% and/or a glucose infusion commenced. b. Type II Diabetes: Consider reduction/withholding insulin dose and/ or oral hypoglycaemic agents depending on severity / precipitant / recurrent hypoglycaemia, but need to ensure the patient does not have type I Diabetes and ensure parent team review. Recurrent hypoglycaemia or failure to improve: Contact endocrine team or medical registrar or Rapid response/Code Blue if clinically indicated.","title":"Hypoglycaemia"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Hypothyroidism/","text":"Hypothyroidism Background underactivity of thyroid gland diagnosed typically on elevated TSH Risk factors pregnancy female gender intercurrent autoimmune disease advanced age family history ionised radiation exposure previous thyroidectomy Primary hypothyroidism - predominant cause of hypothyroidism Hashmotor's thyroiditis is more common cause in > 8 years RAI/surgical management of hyperthyroidism subacute thyroiditis iodine imbalance congenital and porlonged iodide treatment Secondary hypothyroidism pituitary dysfunction, neoplasia, infiltrative disease Tertiary hypothyroidism hypothalamic granuloma/neoplasia Diagnosis Common symptoms - lethargy, weight gain, cold intolerance, hyperphonia, constipation, myaesthenia, arthralgia, xeroderma, peripheral paraesthesia, alopecia amenorrhoea / menstrual abnormalities and erectile dysfunction depressed mood with blunted affect and limited motivation Investigations TSH -> T3/T4 Elevated TSH T3/T4 low FBC, EUC, CMP, LFT, fasting lipids, glucose, HbA1c Anemia Consider coeliac screen TPO Ab - hashimotos thyroiditis Management Thyroxine supplementation 25-50mcg PO OD Uptitrated with TSH every 4-6 weeks","title":"Hypothyroidism"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Hypothyroidism/#hypothyroidism","text":"","title":"Hypothyroidism"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Hypothyroidism/#background","text":"underactivity of thyroid gland diagnosed typically on elevated TSH Risk factors pregnancy female gender intercurrent autoimmune disease advanced age family history ionised radiation exposure previous thyroidectomy Primary hypothyroidism - predominant cause of hypothyroidism Hashmotor's thyroiditis is more common cause in > 8 years RAI/surgical management of hyperthyroidism subacute thyroiditis iodine imbalance congenital and porlonged iodide treatment Secondary hypothyroidism pituitary dysfunction, neoplasia, infiltrative disease Tertiary hypothyroidism hypothalamic granuloma/neoplasia","title":"Background"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Hypothyroidism/#diagnosis","text":"Common symptoms - lethargy, weight gain, cold intolerance, hyperphonia, constipation, myaesthenia, arthralgia, xeroderma, peripheral paraesthesia, alopecia amenorrhoea / menstrual abnormalities and erectile dysfunction depressed mood with blunted affect and limited motivation","title":"Diagnosis"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Hypothyroidism/#investigations","text":"TSH -> T3/T4 Elevated TSH T3/T4 low FBC, EUC, CMP, LFT, fasting lipids, glucose, HbA1c Anemia Consider coeliac screen TPO Ab - hashimotos thyroiditis","title":"Investigations"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Hypothyroidism/#management","text":"Thyroxine supplementation 25-50mcg PO OD Uptitrated with TSH every 4-6 weeks","title":"Management"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Insulin%20infusion/","text":"Insulin infusion Fixed rate insulin infusion Some features: - Bolus insulin is no longer given - Long acting or mixed insulin therapies continue - Insulin infusions are delayed in hypokalemia - Consider discontinuing the insulin pump whilst running insulin infusion - Hypoglycaemia is to be corrected with a small bolus (5mL/kh) of 10% dextrose Example regimen: 50U Fast actin insulin (Actrapid, Novorapid) in 50mL NS via syringe at 0.1U/kg/hr","title":"Insulin infusion"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Insulin%20infusion/#insulin-infusion","text":"Fixed rate insulin infusion Some features: - Bolus insulin is no longer given - Long acting or mixed insulin therapies continue - Insulin infusions are delayed in hypokalemia - Consider discontinuing the insulin pump whilst running insulin infusion - Hypoglycaemia is to be corrected with a small bolus (5mL/kh) of 10% dextrose Example regimen: 50U Fast actin insulin (Actrapid, Novorapid) in 50mL NS via syringe at 0.1U/kg/hr","title":"Insulin infusion"},{"location":"Consult%20guide/Endocrinology/Insulin/","text":"Insulin Basal-bolus insulin Uses: Type 1 diabetes Advanced Type 2 diabetes Typical insulin formulation: Basal insulin (long acting) - e.g. glargine, detemir Multiple short-acting doses (Around meal time) - e.g. aspart, lispro, glulisine Example patient 1 - short acting dose at breakfast needs to be increased - prior = 7, post = 14;

Patients who develop delirium have higher mortality, institutionalisation and complication rates and longer lengths of stay than non-delirious patients.

A change in cognition (such as memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance) or the development of a perceptual disturbance that is not better accounted for by a pre-existing or evolving dementia. It is important to obtain a history from carers or relatives if at all possible. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to days) and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day. There is often evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is caused by the direct physiological consequences of a general medical condition; intoxication or substance withdrawal. Delirium is common post-operatively. Delirium can be idiopathic but should still be recognised and managed none-the-less. The Confusion Assessment Method Diagnostic Algorithm ( Inouye \u2013 Annals of Internal Medicine 1990 ) is a useful tool to assess a patient for delirium: Acute onset and fluctuating course Inattention Disorganised thinking Altered level of consciousness Be aware \u2013 often patients are demented and the confusional episode you are seeing is \u201csun downing\u201d \u2013 but always assume it is delirium if you are in doubt . Delirium necessitates thorough management to avoid harm to the patient. Drowsy delirious patients should be seen as a medical emergency. If you believe the patient is delirious management can be divided into 3 main areas: Identifying and treating the underlying causes of the patient\u2019s delirium Practical approaches to keeping the patient safe Medical treatment of delirium Possible causes Review medications \u2013 remove any medications that are not required Review antipsychotics - e.g. tricyclic antidepressants Review cardiac medications - e.g. methyldopa, antiarrhythmics, betablockers Review steroids Review antidepressants Review anticholinergics Review sedatives (e.g. benzodiazepines) Review opioids.

Whilst CRP is not specific in confirming sepsis it remains a useful test. Blood cultures Calcium Urea and electrolytes Liver function tests \u2013 look for evidence of prior alcohol consumption (GGT) and the nutritional status Glucose Thyroid function tests Chest X-ray ECG Urinalysis and culture Consider CT head and ABG if clinically indicated and if appropriate within the patient\u2019s advanced care directives Delirium often has more than one causal factor (i.e. multiple aetiologies) \u2013 so always keep looking!

If a patient falls on the wards there are several steps that would be very important to patient care. If the patient has had a head strike or there is a possibility of head injury order and review a CT head. This is a key recommendation of the Clinical Excellence Commission (CEC).

If you require assistance with an elderly patient falling whilst under your care seek a geriatrician review to make recommendations to limit future risk of falls. All patients admitted to the hospital ward should be assessed by either the medical team or admitting nurse for falls risk. We currently use the ONTARIO-STRATIFY falls risk assessment.

All confused patients should be assumed at high risk of falls and interventions and plans made to limit the patient\u2019s risk There are many interventions that can lessen the patient\u2019s risk of falls: If the patient is frail and requires assistance to the toilet arrange for scheduled nursing reviews and regular toileting assistance. If the patient is physically weak reinforce with the them the need to ask for assistance for transfers. Use the family to reinforce this need and enable the patient by ensuring the nursing call bell is in easy reach of the patient. Ensure the patient\u2019s mobility aids are well-placed and within easy reach Clear any clutter or furniture that might trip the patient Provide the patient with non-slip socks and remove any slippers or non-ideal footwear. If the patient is delirious ask for a geriatrician to provide recommendations and assistance with delirium management. Always review the patients medications.
