Situation The reason you are calling - include pertinent findings, history, exam and radiology results I have a 91 year old lady with new diagnosis of heart failure for which we are requesting your support to initiate antifailure medications on Background The background and presenting complaint of the patient Try your best to figure out the relevant features for the patient and the question being asked She presented to ED 3 days ago in APO. Her formal echo this morning demonstrated an apical akinesis in the LV with a LVEF of 25%. She has no other history of cardiac disease and has had no obvious precipitants including viral or stressors. She has reported 3 months of worsening exertional dyspnoea and her exercise tolerance is limited to 5m on the flat. Her NYHA is probably around IV as she cannot get dressed without feeling breathlessness. She is currently on only perindopril as an antifailure agent. She has a past medical history of uncontrolled T2DM with a HbA1c of 10.5% and an uncontrolled hypertension with SBPs ranging between 180-200 throughout this admission Assessment Here you demonstrate the assessment of the patient. Remember, the person on the other side of the phone has never seen your patient! She examines fluid overloaded and hemodynamically stable.

Her JVP is elevated at 10cm. She is normally on frusemide 20mg OD but we have had to increase this to 40mg IV BD whilst an inpatient and have started a 1.2L fluid restriction.

Be particularly cautious in the scoring of attention and calculation as this test accounts for a large proportion of the score and is notorious for being inaccurately scored. Spelling WORLD is seen as being a more demanding and sensitive test thant serial 7s. It is useful to document if the patient has either a limited education or a high baseline function. If the Patient is CALD/NESB we would recommend the use of the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Score (RUDAS). Copies of this tool are available on the ward.

A change in cognition (such as memory deficit, disorientation, language disturbance) or the development of a perceptual disturbance that is not better accounted for by a pre-existing or evolving dementia. It is important to obtain a history from carers or relatives if at all possible. The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to days) and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day. There is often evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is caused by the direct physiological consequences of a general medical condition; intoxication or substance withdrawal. Delirium is common post-operatively. Delirium can be idiopathic but should still be recognised and managed none-the-less. The Confusion Assessment Method Diagnostic Algorithm ( Inouye \u2013 Annals of Internal Medicine 1990 ) is a useful tool to assess a patient for delirium: Acute onset and fluctuating course Inattention Disorganised thinking Altered level of consciousness Be aware \u2013 often patients are demented and the confusional episode you are seeing is \u201csun downing\u201d \u2013 but always assume it is delirium if you are in doubt . Delirium necessitates thorough management to avoid harm to the patient. Drowsy delirious patients should be seen as a medical emergency. If you believe the patient is delirious management can be divided into 3 main areas: Identifying and treating the underlying causes of the patient\u2019s delirium Practical approaches to keeping the patient safe Medical treatment of delirium Possible causes Review medications \u2013 remove any medications that are not required Review antipsychotics - e.g. tricyclic antidepressants Review cardiac medications - e.g. methyldopa, antiarrhythmics, betablockers Review steroids Review antidepressants Review anticholinergics Review sedatives (e.g. benzodiazepines) Review opioids. NSAIDs can also cause confusion (esp Indomethacin) Review diabetic medications \u2013 is the patient hypoglycaemic? Review anticonvulsants (E.g. barbituates) Review antiparkinsonian agents (e.g. Benztropine) Review antihistamines (1st generation e.g. Diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine) Review bowel habits \u2013 is the patient constipated? Antispasmotics and H2 blockers can enhance this issue Is the patient in urinary retention? Is the patient in pain but cannot explain this to you? Is the patient thirsty or dehydrated?

Where ever possible, seek corroborative history from the carer. Often patients have been delirious before and a prior aetiology should be reviewed again, eg:e.g. recurrent UTIs \u2013 Check the patient\u2019s notes as well!! Examination A full physical examination should be carried out including in particular the following areas: Conscious level Orientation Attention (e.g. serial 7`s, months of year backwards \u2013 observation of patient behaviour) Evidence of pyrexia / finding a source of sepsis eg Aspiration Pneumonia or UTI or cannula infection Neurological examination (including assessment of speech) Evidence of alcohol abuse or withdrawal (e.g. tremor) Investigations The following investigations are almost always indicated in patients with delirium in order to identify the underlying cause: Full blood count CRP \u2013 typically sepsis is considered in CRP >100 though it can still be considered with CRPs > 50. Whilst CRP is not specific in confirming sepsis it remains a useful test. Blood cultures Calcium Urea and electrolytes Liver function tests \u2013 look for evidence of prior alcohol consumption (GGT) and the nutritional status Glucose Thyroid function tests Chest X-ray ECG Urinalysis and culture Consider CT head and ABG if clinically indicated and if appropriate within the patient\u2019s advanced care directives Delirium often has more than one causal factor (i.e. multiple aetiologies) \u2013 so always keep looking! Management Remove medications that are unnecessary or harmful Commence antibiotics if there is a clinical suspicion of sepsis Correct biochemical derangements (especially hyponatremia and hypercalcemia) Always advise the nursing staff of your planned approach to the patient\u2019s delirium \u2013 be particular about your instructions regarding sedatives and restraints.

There are a few definitions to be aware of: Injurious vs. non-injurious falls An injurious fall is one which causes an injury (E.g. fracture, head-strike) a non-injurious fall is one which doesn't cause physical injury Falls are a major cause of morbidity and disability to elderly patients. Fear of falling can be disabling and greatly affect the patient\u2019s quality of life. 1 year mortality after a hip fracture is currently 20-30%. If a patient falls on the wards there are several steps that would be very important to patient care. If the patient has had a head strike or there is a possibility of head injury order and review a CT head. This is a key recommendation of the Clinical Excellence Commission (CEC).

If you require assistance with an elderly patient falling whilst under your care seek a geriatrician review to make recommendations to limit future risk of falls. All patients admitted to the hospital ward should be assessed by either the medical team or admitting nurse for falls risk. We currently use the ONTARIO-STRATIFY falls risk assessment. It is an embedded part of the current nursing admission form.

All confused patients should be assumed at high risk of falls and interventions and plans made to limit the patient\u2019s risk There are many interventions that can lessen the patient\u2019s risk of falls: If the patient is frail and requires assistance to the toilet arrange for scheduled nursing reviews and regular toileting assistance. If the patient is physically weak reinforce with the them the need to ask for assistance for transfers. Use the family to reinforce this need and enable the patient by ensuring the nursing call bell is in easy reach of the patient. Ensure the patient\u2019s mobility aids are well-placed and within easy reach Clear any clutter or furniture that might trip the patient Provide the patient with non-slip socks and remove any slippers or non-ideal footwear. If the patient is delirious ask for a geriatrician to provide recommendations and assistance with delirium management. Always review the patients medications. Antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and most psychoactive medications will increase the risk of falls and if deemed unnecessary should be discontinued.
