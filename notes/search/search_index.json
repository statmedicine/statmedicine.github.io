It is a collection of everything that has scared the living sh*t out of me in medicine, and everything which I didn't feel prepared for on my way in. The goal of STAT notes is the document basic and important approaches to clinical problems which you might see whilst on a night shift, or weekend shift. Common clinical reviews, etc. Common calls Be familiar with the following: Hypertension Hypotension Hyperglycaemia Hypoglycaemia Altered mental status Necessary skills Be very comfortable with the following skills: Charting fluids DISCLAIMER Do NOT treat ANYTHING on this website as medical advice.
