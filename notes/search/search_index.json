Resuscitation fluids are always normal saline (0.9% NaCl). Bolus fluids are typically administered depending on medical history and risk factors. A good approach is as follows: If patients have cardiac failure, kidney or liver failure, or at risk of fluid overloading , bolus with ~150mL at a time If patients are older or with poorer kidney function , bolus with ~250mL at a time If patients are otherwise well individuals, bolus with ~500mL at a time After bolusing a patient, you should reassess within 15 minutes. If there are ongoing issues, you can rebolus with 250-500mL.
